## Faithbridge's Biblically Guided Positions on Current Social Issues

The doctrine outlined in the convictions, persuasions, and opinions is the basis of how we understand God and His will for our lives in all matters of faith and practice. It is the foundation of all teachings, sermons, Bible studies, Grow Group curriculum, and instructs and informs how we act, speak, behave, and live as disciples of Jesus Christ.
This doctrine is unchanging—as it describes the eternal truths of God. However, we continue to update our teachings so that they are clearly understood to a constantly changing culture and society. We believe it is good practice to keep a short, up-to-date list of “frequently asked questions” of our understandings on certain current issues. These carefully worded positions are grounded in the eternal truths found in the Bible.
We ask that you keep these three principles in mind as you read through this list:
    
    1. We are aware that the Church, historically and globally, has not always stewarded well the balance of biblical truth with loving grace and acceptance in all areas. 
    2. We believe peace is found in the truth of the Gospel, which calls us to keep our eyes on Jesus and His outrageous love, forgiveness, and extension of grace to all who would believe in Him.
    3. These positions are not ranked in importance, they are merely our best effort at applying God's authoritative Word to our culture's current most frequently asked questions.

Please read these carefully and indicate any statements you cannot support with integrity to discuss with a Faithbridge staff leader.
