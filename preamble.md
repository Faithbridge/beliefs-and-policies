## Faithbridge Doctrine Guideline for Prospective Leaders & Staff Members

Prayerfully review the following doctrine guideline with the understanding that these beliefs and issues have varying levels of importance to each person. Faithbridge seeks team members who:

- passionately share the same belief convictions, and
- are comfortable ministering alongside others who may or maynot share the exact same belief persuasions or opinions.

We believe if our differences involve convictions, we should not attempt ministering together. But we are comfortable with your holding differeng persuasions and opinions if you can model, teach, and promote Faithbridge's positions without feeling your integrity is compromised.
