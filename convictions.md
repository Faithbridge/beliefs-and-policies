## Convictions
### Core Christian beliefs that we believe are the essence of Christianity.

[] *Authority of Scripture* - The sole basis of our beliefs is the Bible, the 66 canonical books of the Old and New Testaments. The Bible is the Word of God, fully true; our final authority in all matters of faithbridge, practice, and lifestyle.

[] *God* - There is One true God who exists eternally in three Persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, who are of one substance and equal in power and glory.
